# p5js-sketches

None of this code should be taken seriously. It is mainly testing done with the p5.js library in order to visualize concepts or just to mess around and practice. The code will be messy, bodged, and probably not functional after some time. I've named the page 'sketches' as it represents everything here; rough work that may act as a guide for future projects (or to be discarded). Enjoy.
